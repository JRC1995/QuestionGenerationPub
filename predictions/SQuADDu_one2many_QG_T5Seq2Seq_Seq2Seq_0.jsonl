'' on 26 february 1832 chopin gave a debut paris concert at the salle pleyel which drew universal admiration . the critic françois-joseph fétis wrote in the revue et gazette musicale : `` here is a young man who ... taking no model , has found , if not a complete renewal of piano music , ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ... '' after this concert , chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces . later that year he was introduced to the wealthy rothschild banking family , whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons -lrb- social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite -rrb- . by the end of 1832 chopin had established himself among the parisian musical elite , and had earned the respect of his peers such as hiller , liszt , and berlioz . he no longer depended financially upon his father , and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over europe . this freed him from the strains of public concert-giving , which he disliked .", "predictions": ["who was chopin's critic?", "what was chopin's debut paris concert?", "what was chopin's first published article on music?"]}
